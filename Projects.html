        <h3>Creating my own personal website</h3>
        <br>
        <p> 
        My first project is this personal résumé and portfolio website, designed
        to showcase my skills, experience, and growth in the IT and cybersecurity 
        field. I built it as a way to present my professional background, highlight
        the work I’ve completed, and create a foundation for future projects as I continue developing my programming and technical abilities.
